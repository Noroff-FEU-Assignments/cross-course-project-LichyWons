    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks?</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">I would explain that a website is an online space for anyone to access his information or services. However, anyone can access his website without permission if the security features are not in place.</p> 
    <p>I would advise to
     use more effective password management
     Encourage strong passwords. Consider two-factor authentication for the site, so that in addition to a password the user must enter another authentication code
     Not to give or show to anyone his password ang login details
     Only store and display data that he needs. For example, if his users must store sensitive information like credit card details, only display enough of the card number that it can be identified by the user, and not enough that it can be copied by an attacker and used on another site. The most common pattern at this time is to only display the last 4 digits of a credit card number.
